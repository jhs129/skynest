## How to Use This Vault

1. Read \`.context/config.yaml\` for nest configuration and folder descriptions
2. Read \`INDEX.md\` for a summary of all documents, their types, status, and tags
3. Use \`context.yaml\` to understand the document graph
4. Start with hub documents (highest inbound links) for broad context
5. Follow \`contextnest://\` links within documents to traverse related content

## Operating Instructions

- Always cite sources by document path
- Prefer published documents over drafts
