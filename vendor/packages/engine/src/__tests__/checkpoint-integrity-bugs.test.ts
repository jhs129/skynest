/**
 * Regression tests for two checkpoint-integrity defects, now FIXED.
 *
 *   Bug 1 — non-atomic checkpoint seal references a superseded chain_hash.
 *           `publishDocument` reads the published-doc snapshot (publish.ts:91)
 *           and the per-doc history snapshot (publish.ts:95) in two separate
 *           phases with no lock, then hands both to `createCheckpoint`. Under
 *           rapid/concurrent publishing the doc head can advance between the
 *           two reads, so the checkpoint seals `document_versions[doc] = N`
 *           from one read but `document_chain_hashes[doc]` from the other —
 *           a checkpoint that points at a chain_hash the doc no longer has at
 *           that version. `verifyCheckpointChain` flags it as
 *           `cross_chain_mismatch`.
 *
 *   Bug 2 — `rebuildCheckpointHistory` is a re-derivation, not a repair.
 *           It copies each per-doc `chain_hash` straight off disk
 *           (checkpoint.ts:349) WITHOUT validating the per-doc chain, and emits
 *           one checkpoint per (doc, version) tuple with different semantics
 *           than the live path (at = published_at, triggered_by = docId). So a
 *           tampered per-doc chain survives the rebuild and is even laundered
 *           into a checkpoint chain that then verifies "clean" — no convergence
 *           toward a correct state.
 *
 * These tests failed against the pre-fix engine (the original reproduction) and
 * pass now that the publish path seals from a snapshot gathered inside the lock
 * (Bug 1) and the rebuild recomputes/validates chains before re-sealing (Bug 2).
