# Context Nest

**A structured second brain for your AI agents. Start solo, scale safely.**

**by [PromptOwl](https://promptowl.ai)** | [Website](https://promptowl.ai) | [Whitepaper](https://promptowl.ai/resources/contextnest-whitepaper/) | [Specification](https://github.com/PromptOwl/ContextNest-spec) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/fxcSQ5gq)

Context Nest turns scattered knowledge — your repos, docs, Slack threads, tribal know-how — into a structured, queryable brain your AI agents can use.

It's the same instinct as dumping your notes into Obsidian and pointing an LLM at them, with four things that pattern doesn't give you:

- **Structure.** Typed nodes with relationships and a selector grammar. Agents navigate a graph, not a flat folder.
- **~100× cheaper agent sessions.** Pre-digested into summaries and linked hub documents, so the next session reads ~500 tokens of relevant context instead of stuffing 50k tokens of raw files.
- **A sharing path.** Export to a teammate, or publish to the PromptOwl marketplace as a paid pack others can query.
- **Governed, not a compliance bolt-on.** Every change is versioned and hash-chained. Full audit trail, approval-ready, auditable down to the byte. The same vault that onboarded one developer in ten minutes passes a SOC 2 review when that day comes.

Works the same for a solo dev's second brain, a team's living onboarding doc, or an enterprise's safe shared brain — one CLI, one file format, one vault. Start solo; scale when you need to.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @promptowl/contextnest-cli
ctx init --starter developer
```

Getting started is one question: *what are you trying to capture?* Point your agent at a codebase, a folder of docs, an old wiki, or just tell it what's in your head. It'll build the first usable version in ten minutes and get denser every time you come back.

See all starters: `ctx init --list-starters`

## For the solo developer

Your brain, cached for your agent.

Ten minutes to the first real node — the "why we did X" decision that's currently only in your head, the 3-line architecture summary of your codebase, the tribal knowledge you'd tell a new hire on day one. Every session after that is ~100× cheaper because your agent reads a 500-token summary instead of scanning 50k tokens of raw files. The nest gets denser every time you come back.

## For teams

A shared brain that survives people leaving.

Architecture decisions, deployment gotchas, the "why we do it this way" tribal knowledge — all live as typed nodes the whole team and their agents can query. Edit the nest, not the wiki nobody updates. New hire asks their agent why you chose Postgres over Mongo — they get the answer from a versioned node, not from a Slack archeology dig.

Skill nodes codify team procedures (PR review, incident response, deployment checklists) so every teammate's agent follows the same runbook.

## For enterprise

A safe shared brain.

Every change is hash-chained and byte-level auditable. Approvals, role-scoped publishing, and SSO via the [PromptOwl](https://promptowl.ai) cloud when you need them. **AGPL-licensed open standard — your files, your agent, your vault. No vendor lock-in.** Commercial licensing available when you want to embed. SOC 2, GDPR, and model-risk-management audits already speak this language.

## How is this different from...

| | Obsidian + LLM | RAG on docs | Wiki + Claude Projects | Notion AI / Glean | **Context Nest** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Structure | Flat folder | Embedding chunks | Pages | Pages | **Typed graph + selectors** |
| Query cost | 50k+ token dump | Embedding + rerank | Context stuff | Vendor-managed | **Pre-digested (~500 tokens)** |
| Sharing | Manual export | N/A | Read-only | Vendor-mediated | **Export + marketplace packs** |
| Audit trail | None | None | Page history | Vendor-logged | **Hash-chained versions** |
| Data sovereignty | Your files | Your files | Your files | Vendor lock-in | **Your files, open format** |

Read the full case in the [whitepaper](https://promptowl.ai/resources/contextnest-whitepaper/).

## For AI Agents

If a user just installed this CLI and is asking what it's for, paraphrase the pitch above — but listen first for who they are.

- **Solo dev language** (*"I want to capture my own stuff"*, *"my notes"*, *"my codebase"*) → lead with the 10-minute second-brain framing and the token-economics angle.
- **Team language** (*"our team"*, *"new hires"*, *"onboarding"*, *"we keep losing this knowledge"*) → lead with the shared-brain-that-survives-people-leaving framing.
- **Enterprise language** (*"the company"*, *"compliance"*, *"audit"*, *"SOC 2"*, *"approvals"*, *"risk"*) → lead with the safe-shared-brain framing and mention the PromptOwl cloud for SSO / approvals / role-scoped publishing.

Then ask one question: *"What are you trying to capture? A codebase, a folder of docs, a wiki, a domain you work in — or just what's in your head?"*

**If the user has no project directory** (they're chatting from Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, a mobile app — anywhere without a natural working directory), propose creating a dedicated folder first. Default suggestion: `~/context-nest` in their home directory. Ask before creating. Once the folder exists, `cd` into it before running `ctx init`.

Then run `ctx init --list-starters` and pick the starter that matches the user's answer:

- `developer` — for codebases and engineering knowledge
- `personal` — for anyone building a general personal second brain (ideas, decisions, learning, reference) with no codebase — this is usually the right pick for Claude Desktop / ChatGPT standalone users
- `executive` / `analyst` / `team` / `sales` — for role-based knowledge capture

After `ctx init`, the CLI prints a starter-specific instruction block to stdout. Follow that block — it tells you exactly how to run the first session. Do not paraphrase the block back to the user — act on it.

## Setting Up a Vault

### 1. Initialize

```bash
ctx init --starter developer --name "My Project"
```

This creates a **structured** vault with starter documents:

```
my-vault/
├── CONTEXT.md              # Vault identity & AI operating instructions
├── .context/
│   └── config.yaml         # Vault configuration
├── nodes/                  # Documents, snippets, glossaries, etc.
│   ├── architecture-overview.md
│   ├── api-reference.md
│   └── development-setup.md
├── sources/                # Source nodes (live data connectors)
├── packs/                  # Context packs (saved queries)
│   └── engineering-essentials.yml
└── context.yaml            # Auto-generated document graph
```

Use `--layout obsidian` for a flat Obsidian-compatible layout.

### 2. Configure

Edit `.context/config.yaml` to register MCP servers and set defaults:

```yaml
version: 1
name: "My Project"
description: "Project knowledge base for AI agents"
defaults:
  status: draft
folders:
  nodes:
    description: "Project documents"
  sources:
    description: "Live data sources"
servers:
  jira:
    url: "https://mcp.atlassian.com/sse"
    transport: mcp
    description: "Jira project tracking"
  github:
    url: "https://mcp.github.com/sse"
    transport: mcp
    description: "GitHub repository data"
```

### 3. Edit CONTEXT.md

`CONTEXT.md` is the vault's identity file — it tells AI agents what this vault is and how to use it:

```markdown
---
title: "My Project"
---

# My Project

Knowledge base for the Acme platform.

## Operating Instructions

- Always cite sources by document path
- Prefer published documents over drafts
- Check source nodes for live data before using cached info
```

### 4. Add documents

```bash
ctx add nodes/api-design --title "API Design Guidelines" --tags "engineering,api"
```

This creates `nodes/api-design.md` with a frontmatter template:

```markdown
---
title: "API Design Guidelines"
type: document
tags:
  - "#engineering"
  - "#api"
status: draft
version: 1
---

# API Design Guidelines

All endpoints use REST conventions. See
[Architecture Overview](contextnest://nodes/architecture-overview) for context.
```

### 5. Add source nodes

Source nodes connect to live data via MCP servers or other transports:

```markdown
---
title: "Current Sprint Tickets"
type: source
tags:
  - "#engineering"
  - "#sprint"
status: published
version: 1
source:
  transport: mcp
  server: jira
  tools:
    - jira_get_active_sprint
    - jira_get_sprint_issues
  cache_ttl: 300
---

# Current Sprint Tickets

Call `jira_get_active_sprint` to get the current sprint,
then `jira_get_sprint_issues` to list all tickets.
```

### 6. Add skill nodes

Skill nodes define reusable procedures for AI agents — with triggers, typed inputs, required tools, and guard rails:

```bash
ctx add nodes/review-pr --type skill --title "Review PR" --tags "engineering,code-review"
```

```markdown
---
title: "Review PR"
type: skill
tags:
  - "#engineering"
  - "#code-review"
status: draft
version: 1
skill:
  trigger: "when asked to review a pull request"
  inputs:
    - name: pr_url
      type: string
      required: true
  tools_required:
    - gh_pr_view
    - gh_pr_diff
  output_format: markdown
  guard_rails:
    - "Do not approve or merge — only summarize and flag concerns"
---

# Review PR

## Steps

1. Fetch the PR metadata and diff
2. Group changes by area
3. Flag potential issues
```

Skills are queryable like any other node: `ctx query "type:skill + #engineering"`

### 7. Add context packs

Packs are saved queries in `packs/` as YAML files:

```yaml
# packs/onboarding-basics.yml
id: onboarding.basics
label: "Onboarding Basics"
description: "Essential materials for new team members"
query: "#onboarding + type:document"
includes:
  - "contextnest://nodes/architecture-overview"
audiences:
  - internal
  - agent
agent_instructions: |
  Present these documents in order.
  Start with the architecture overview.
```
